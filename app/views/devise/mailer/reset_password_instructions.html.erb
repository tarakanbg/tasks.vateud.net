<p>Hello <%= @resource.email %>!</p>

<p>Someone (hopefully you) has requested a link to change your password for the VATEUD Tasks application.
 You can do this through the link below.</p>

<p><%= link_to 'Change my password', edit_password_url(@resource, :reset_password_token => @token) %></p>

<p>If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.</p>
<p>Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.</p>

<p>Good luck and have a great day!</p>
<p><em><strong>The VATEUD Web Services Team</strong></em></p>
